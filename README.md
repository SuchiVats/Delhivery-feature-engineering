# Delhivery Feature Engineering

## Overview
This project involves processing raw logistics data to extract meaningful features for Delhivery's forecasting models. The data contains details about trip routes, delivery times, and distances. Through feature engineering, we aim to improve predictions and optimize Delhivery's operations.

## Steps Involved
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the data structure and relationships.
- **Feature Creation**: Extract features like time, route information, and more.
- **Merging Rows & Aggregation**: Aggregate data for trips with multiple segments.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Compare various delivery time and distance metrics.
- **Handling Missing Values & Outliers**: Clean data for better model accuracy.
- **Normalization & Standardization**: Scale numerical data for machine learning.
- **Business Insights**: Identify trends and recommend operational improvements.

## Getting Started
To run the notebook, ensure that the following Python packages are installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Conclusion
The project aims to help Delhivery understand its logistics operations better, reduce delivery times, and improve forecasting for future trips.
